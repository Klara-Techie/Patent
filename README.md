# Patent : SYSTEM AND METHOD TO ELIMINATE SALT FORMATION ON ELECTRODES
## Abstract :
  A system to eliminate salt formation on electrode(s) is provided. The system includes processor(s) electrically coupled to the
electrode(s) including at least one reference electrode and multiple sensing electrodes. The system also includes a voltage transmission
subsystem which transmits a reference voltage to the at least one reference electrode for a pre-defined interval of time periodically
with a first predefined time value as a first predefined time period. Further, the system includes a salt eliminator subsystem including a
liquid level detection subsystem which senses the reference voltage from one of the multiple sensing electrodes and determines a level
of the liquid, and including an electrode polarity reversal subsystem which transmits the reference voltage after every second
predefined time period alternately, to first of the multiple sensing electrodes adjacent to the at least one reference electrode and the at
least one reference electrode to eliminate the salt formation on the electrode(s)
